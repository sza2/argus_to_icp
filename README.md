Reverse engineered Argus-to-ICP hardware

Argus-to-ICP adapter is an in-circuit programmer for Termomax / Gruppo Imar boards designed by Argus (NL).

The progammer is based on FT232BL USB-serial converter and contains a few additional parts, the core exactly follows FTDI's reference design. Bear in mind, that the reverse engineered schematic may contain errors. Capacitors were not measured values coming from the reference schematic and where it was applicable.
